          <h3>Polling Study</h3>
          <h5>Saturday August 31, 2019</h5>
          <p>
            &emsp;From my experience, I have learned that I/O is typically the chokepoint
            for most systems. This is coming from the fact that processors are lightning
            fast, and the internet and disks are comparatively slow. In a web app which
            I have been building for my work; it is pretty much a glorified database
            accessor where many many calls to the DB are made per second. I do not
            think something like this is uncommon either. When doing my usual
            optimizations upon the code I write, the first step is to immediately
            try to speed up the database queries. In Perl, which is the language my
            company uses, these I/O calls are typically blocking. This means that once
            a call is made to the database, the program will halt execution, pass control
            onto the kernel, and then wait. This wait is done in a relatively efficient manner;
            sitting still until the kernel comes back with the needed resources.
            Unfortunately for the developer, while the computer
            gets a well deserved break, nothing useful is being done during that time.
            "But what if we make our system calls non-blocking?" you probably are asking
            if this info is far too easy for you. Well in that case you would be totally
            right. We are going to learn how to use certain methods and tactics to allow
            your machine to do these calls asynchronously in order to waste as little time
            waiting as possible. C will be our language to use today because of the low level
            control and system commands it makes available to us.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some sources that I used in order to get a grasp on this idea:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSB23S_1.1.0.14/gtpc2/cpp_poll.html">pollâ€“Monitor activity on file descriptors</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzab6/poll.htm">Using poll() instead of select()</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/named-pipe-fifo-example-c-program/">Named Pipe or FIFO with example C program</a> (not necessary)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            &emsp;By looking at these links, you will see that the commonality between them is 'poll'.
            That is the system call we are going to be looking into to achieve our asynchronous
            responses. If you plan to really get a grasp on this concept, you must read the entirety of
            each article listed above. You also need to try and execute each code example found in
            said articles. If your are not comfortable with a lot of these system calls, the 'Named Pipe...' (4)
            one is nice to start with. If you can understand and explain every line in the two example
            programs then you'll be in good shape. Let's get into things.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;Starting with the man page (1), the poll system call that "waits for one of a
            set of file descriptors to become ready to perform I/O." This sounds like what already
            happens, which is kind of true, but you'll see in a little bit where the magic comes in.
            In the header file, the call is defined as:
          </p>
          <code>
            <pre>
              int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);
            </pre>
          </code>
          <p>
            Here is an associated data structure that it uses:
          </p>
          <code>
            <pre>
              struct pollfd {
                int   fd;         /* file descriptor */
                short events;     /* requested events */
                short revents;    /* returned events */
              };
            </pre>
          </code>
          <p>
            &emsp;The idea here is that the poll function is given an array of the above
            structures, and poll will populate the returned events for you. You hand
            the function all the file descriptors  with a bitmask of events you want
            monitored. There is a list of these events on the website. I have been
            using the following to poll for readable and writable fd's:
          </p>
          <code>
            <pre>
              ds[i].events = POLLIN | POLLOUT;
            </pre>
          </code>
          <p>
            &emsp;Notice how I use the pipe between the two? For those who may not know,
            the single pipe is an OR operator. You will need to know how those work
            to understand bitmasks. After you intialize your file descriptors with
            the desired events, you call the poll function. Make sure to error check
            the return value for any issues or timeouts. Afterwards, you check the
            revents to see which event has been set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a small example snippet of code for you to try and digest:
          </p>
          <code>
            <pre>
              /* Note this wont compile, but you should try and fix it     */
              int rc, nfds = 1;
              struct pollfd fds[200];

              /* Initialize the pollfd structure                           */
              memset(fds, 0 , sizeof(fds));

              /* Set up the initial listening socket                       */
              fds[0].fd = listen_sd;
              fds[0].events = POLLIN;
              /* Initialize the timeout to 3 minutes.                      */
              timeout = (3 * 60 * 1000);

              rc = poll(fds, nfds, timeout);

              /* Check to see if the poll call failed.                   */
              if (rc < 0)
              {
                perror("  poll() failed");
                break;
              }

              /* Check to see if the 3 minute time out expired.          */
              if (rc == 0)
              {
                printf("  poll() timed out.  End program.\n");
                break;
              }

              /* Right now this will only execute once, unless you add   */
              /* on more file descriptor. Also note this one is a socket */
              current_size = nfds;
              for (i = 0; i < current_size; i++)
              {
                /* Loop through to find the descriptors that returned    */
                /* POLLIN and determine whether it's the listening       */
                /* or the active connection.                             */
                if(fds[i].revents == 0)
                  continue;

                /* If revents is not POLLIN, it's an unexpected result,  */
                /* log and end the server.                               */
                if( !(fds[i].revents & POLLIN) )
                {
                  printf("  Error! revents = %d\n", fds[i].revents);
                  end_server = TRUE;
                  break;
                }
                if ( fds[i].fd == listen_sd )
                {
                  // READ YOUR FILE DESCRIPTOR HERE
                }
              }
            </pre>
          </code>
          <p>
            &emsp;As you can see, there is a quite a bit that goes into all of this.
            The structure and psuedocode here is the important part. If you want to
            add more file descriptors, which you undoubtedly will, you need to intialize
            the pollfd structure as the example does above. This means you can decide if
            you want a POLLIN or POLLOUT or both for each individual fd.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;The magic is that the poll call will check at once to see if a lot of file
            descriptors are ready. This is significantly better than waiting for once to get
            ready. I wrote a basic HTTP server with only using the typical read and accept calls
            that ended up maxing out at 39 requests processed per second. Once upgraded to the
            polling server, it maxed out at 2,000 req/s. An unbelieveable boost in performance.
            Hopefully, it is possible to make a server reach up into the hundreds of thousands
            requests per second.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;The thing is, though, that this method of reading files asynchronously
            is pretty slow. You loop through each one and see if it's ready to do stuff
            to. This means that you have to check every single one of the file descriptors.
            This makes it a linear time a.k.a. O(n) operation, which slows down under a
            heavy load. Because of this, I won't spend much longer explaining this topic
            since I wanted this to be a small introduction to point someone in the right
            direction. For the next part of this write-up, I will explore a bit of research
            I am doing in order expand upon the polling functionality. Thanks for reading,
            stay tuned for more!
