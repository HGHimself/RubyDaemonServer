          <h3>Color Study</h3>
          <h5>Monday September 23, 2019</h5>
          <br>
          <p>&emsp;Cheers all, I wanted to do a write up about some ongoing work of mine related to color systems
            and a few math functions I came up with. In order to cycle through the RGB colors, you need to use three
            offset sine waves. With these, any number as an input will result in the output of a primary color.
            Due to the nature of sine and circles, there are quite a few properties of these functions. I have a couple
            web apps below in order to explore these properties. The first circles this color wheel, plotting colors onto
            cells in a square. It does a great job at illustrating the fundemental differences between squares and circles,
            and how some interesting things happen when you mix them. The second is a deeper look into these functions and
            how a couple small changes in constants can bring up a huge change in the output of colors. Maybe I will link
            these two apps together in order to expand the expirimentation possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>&emsp;Changing the muliplier makes the circle intervals bigger or smaller. This means the 'space' between
            two colors can either get bigger or smaller. With the right amount of space, you can make the adjacent colors
            far apart or close together on the spectrum, resulting in many different color combinations. I have found that
            any multiples of pi always give great results. Specifically <code>31.4159265</code> looks great with more than
            25 elements. Have a play around and see what cool things you can find. Towards the bottom are some things I found.

          <h6>Intro</h6>
          <p>&emsp;I wanted to do a write up about these three functions I came up with back in 2015.
            This was when I was making up space invaders type game using C and SDL2. The idea was to make the
            game as colorful as possible so I had thought it would be cool to have the colors cycle through
            the spectrum based on where the player is. Here are a few images:
          </p>
          <br>
          <div class='row'>
            <div class='col'>
              <img src="/img/celestia.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            </div>
            <div class='col'>
              <img src="/img/celestia1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            </div>
            <div class='col'>
              <img src="/img/celestia2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>&emsp;As you may be able to tell, the colors are dependant upon where on the x axis your player lies.
            To achieve this functionality, I needed to write some sort of function that takes in a number and
            spits out a color. As any good millenial, I took to the internet to do some research on the topic.
            I found a lot of discussion about cycling through the color spectrum but I could not see any answers.
            The closest I could get was this article about manipulating LEDs<a href='https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Proper-Rainbow-and-Random-Colors-With-/' target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer”>[1]</a>.
            This was enough to get me started though. The image linked below if it still exists, provided
            a lot of inspiration.

              <p>&emsp;If you're into maths, you will recognize that these squigglies look exactly like sine waves.
                At this point, I was especially glad I payed attention to my physics lecture back in college. I
                went back to google to look up Simple Harmonic Motion, which I will give a quick description of here.
              </p>
              <p>&emsp;Wikipedia opens the SHM page with: "In mechanics and physics, simple harmonic motion is a special
                type of periodic motion or oscillation where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement
                and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement."<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion'>[2]</a>.
                This complicated description pretty much means that it is a way to define simplified motion that sways back and forth similarly to waves.
                For our sine waves, this is exactly what we need.
